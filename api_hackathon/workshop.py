"""Participant file -- improve these working-but-unreliable baselines.

Quick start
-----------
1. Run  python demo.py          to see the raw AI output for all four levels.
2. Edit the functions below one at a time.
3. Run  python score.py --team "Your Team" --open   to see your score and a
   visual report in the browser.

The API being reviewed has three endpoints (see http://localhost:8081/api/v1):

    GET  /orders               list orders, optional ?limit=<int>
    POST /orders               create an order  (Bearer auth required)
    GET  /orders/{orderId}     fetch one order  (Bearer auth required)

The AI assistant (ai.ask(...)) always returns a list of dicts. The shapes are
shown in the comments below. Your job is to filter that list so only items
that are verifiable against real evidence survive.

    ai.ask("contract_review", spec) returns a list like:

    Tip: check two things for each finding before keeping it.
      1. Does spec["paths"][finding["path"]][finding["method"]] exist?
      2. Does the evidence_pointer resolve to a real location inside spec?
         JSON Pointer: split on "/" first, then decode ~1 to "/" inside a key.
         "/paths/~1orders/get" is spec["paths"]["/orders"]["get"].
         It is not "//orders" -- the slash belongs to the key name "/orders".
